        "- Create reel tracking tasks for specific projects\n",
        "- Monitor Instagram reels with scheduled scraping\n",
        "- Analyze reel performance (likes, comments, views, sentiment)\n",
        "- View tracking results and statistics\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "- **Project-based**: Each reel tracking task belongs to a specific project\n",
        "- **Scheduled Scraping**: Automatic updates every 2 days (configurable)\n",
        "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes comments for positive/negative/neutral sentiment\n",
        "- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks likes, comments, views over time\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "- Valid user account (signup/login)\n",
        "- Instagram reel URLs to track\n",
        "- At least one project created\n",
